Complete Blood Count (CBC)

A Complete Blood Count measures several components of your blood to assess overall health and detect disorders.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS (WBC/Leukocytes)
Normal Range: 4,500-11,000 cells/mcL
What it measures: White blood cells fight infections
High WBC: May indicate infection, inflammation, leukemia, stress, or tissue damage
Low WBC: May indicate bone marrow problems, autoimmune disorders, or certain medications
Dietary support: Vitamin C (citrus, bell peppers), Vitamin E (nuts, seeds), zinc (shellfish, legumes)

RED BLOOD CELLS (RBC/Erythrocytes)
Normal Range: 
- Men: 4.7-6.1 million cells/mcL
- Women: 4.2-5.4 million cells/mcL
What it measures: Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body
High RBC: May indicate dehydration, lung disease, or polycythemia
Low RBC: May indicate anemia, blood loss, or nutritional deficiencies

HEMOGLOBIN (Hgb)
Normal Range:
- Men: 13.5-17.5 g/dL
- Women: 12.0-15.5 g/dL
What it measures: The oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells
High Hemoglobin: Dehydration, lung disease, smoking, high altitude
Low Hemoglobin (Anemia): Iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, chronic disease, blood loss
Foods to increase: Red meat, liver, spinach, lentils, fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds
Take with Vitamin C to enhance iron absorption

HEMATOCRIT (Hct)
Normal Range:
- Men: 38.3-48.6%
- Women: 35.5-44.9%
What it measures: Percentage of blood volume made up of red blood cells
High: Dehydration, lung disease, polycythemia
Low: Anemia, blood loss, malnutrition

PLATELETS
Normal Range: 150,000-400,000 platelets/mcL
What it measures: Blood clotting cells
High: May indicate inflammation, iron deficiency, or bone marrow disorders
Low: May indicate bleeding disorders, autoimmune conditions, or certain medications
